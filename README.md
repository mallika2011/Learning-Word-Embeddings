# Learning-Word-Embeddings

## Setup & Running

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it. 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mallika2011/Learning-Word-Embeddings.git
cd Learning-Word-Embeddings
```

2. Create a virtual env and install requirements
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. There are 4 tasks that can be done : create vocabulary, train svd, train cbow, tokenize corpus
  *  To create the vocabulary run the following. This will create the files `word2count.json`, `word2ind.json`, `ind2word.json`, and `vocabulary.txt` in the `vocab_files` directory
     ```bash
     mkdir vocab_files
     python3 run.py Electronics_5.json 0
     ```
  *  To create the co-occurrence matrix and perform SVD run:
     ```bash
     python3 run.py Electronics_5.json 1
     ```
  *  To train CBOW embeddings run the following. This by default runs CBOW using nn_based method. If the enc-dec method is preferred, comment L:16 and uncomment L:17 in `run.py`:
     ```bash
     python3 run.py Electronics_5.json 2
     ```
  *  To tokenize and store the tokenized corpus run the following. Here the sampling boolean can be altered directly within the script.
     ```bash
     python3 run.py Electronics_5.json 3
     ```

## Model and Large File Links:

All vocabulary files and models for the CBOW method are present in the repo. The link to **co-occurrence matrix models** and the **tokenized_corpus** files (with and without sampling) can be found here:

These are required to be able to directly run the model scripts (for CBOW) without having to create the tokenized corpus.

## Corpus Statistics:

* Total Number of reviews in the corpus = 1.6M
* Reviews used to train models          = 1M
* Total size of the vocabulary created  = 67829 unique words
